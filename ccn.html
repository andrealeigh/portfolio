            <p class="portfolio-ccn-intro-blurb">Call Congress Now is a responsive web app I designed and co-developed. Its purpose is to encourage citizens to call their Representatives and Senators for issues they care about. The app provides calling information in a user-friendly way. </p>

                <p class="portfolio-ccn-blurb">In the weeks following election night, I vowed to get more involved in politics. As I talked with like-minded peers and nodded along as I read rant-filled threads, I started wondering what else I could do besides vote in the next election.</p>
                <p class="portfolio-ccn-blurb">I came across long Twitter threads about the impact of picking up the phone and calling Congress. My friend and I were intrigued. We started looking into how to contact Congress were startled by how little information about it existed. Then we realized that we could do something about that.</p>
