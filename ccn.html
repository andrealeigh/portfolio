            <p class="portfolio-ccn-intro-blurb">Call Congress Now is a responsive web app I designed and co-developed. Its purpose is to encourage citizens to call their Representatives and Senators for issues they care about. The app provides calling information in a user-friendly way. </p>

            <h3 class="portfolio-ccn-process-title">The Design Process: Key Steps</h3>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb">Call Congress Now was a challenging but rewarding app to design and build. I have included key points in the design process below.</p>
            <h3 class="portfolio-ccn-process-header">Discovery</h3>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb">In the weeks following election night, I vowed to get more involved in politics. I came across long Twitter threads about the impact of picking up the phone and calling Congress.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb">My friend and I started looking into how to go about contacting Congress. We were startled by how little information about it existed. Then we realized that we could do something about that.</p>
            <h3 class="portfolio-ccn-process-header">Defining The Idea</h3>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb portfolio-ccn-process-blurb-emphasis">We decided to make a responsive web app that would provide a solution to the following questions:</p>
            <ul class="portfolio-ccn-process-list">
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">What would a user-friendly app with calling information look like?</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">How do we motivate our peers to pick up the phone?</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">Here is a storyboard I created by hand to help define the types of users our app was targeting:</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="portfolio-ccn-process-img" src="images/ccn-storyboard.png" alt="storyboard" />
            <h3 class="portfolio-ccn-process-header">Design</h3>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb portfolio-ccn-process-blurb-emphasis">During the design phase, I created the following:</p>
            <ul class="portfolio-ccn-process-list">
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">Quick paper/pencil wireframes</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">High-fidelity mockups using Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">HTML/SCSS prototypes</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">Branding, such as defining the color scheme, finding a background hero photo, and sketching out an icon (which was inspired by the upside-down flag from House of Cards).</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="portfolio-ccn-process-design-img" src="images/call-congress-now.svg" alt="Call Congress Now icon" />
            <h3 class="portfolio-ccn-process-header">User Research</h3>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb">While designing, I conducted informal interviews with family, friends, and friendly-looking strangers at coffee shops. I wanted to know what motivated them to care about politics, but, like me prior to the election, stopped them from getting more involved.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb portfolio-ccn-process-blurb-emphasis">Here was the general consensus:</p>
            <ul class="portfolio-ccn-process-list">
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">I don&rsquo;t know what specific actions I can take besides voting and donating to causes I care about</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">I only want to consider options that aren&rsquo;t a huge time sink</li>
                <li class="portfolio-ccn-process-list-item">I want to know that my actions will mean something</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb"><span class="portfolio-ccn-process-blurb-emphasis">Conclusion: </span>Answer the question, Why should I do this? </p>
